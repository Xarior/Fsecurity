*Fsecurity*
====================
### A tool that transforms Firefox browsers into a penetration testing suite ###


# How? #
It downloads the most important extensions, and install it on your browser. The used extensions has been chosen by a survey among the information security community. Based on it's results, *Fsecurity* was made. Also, it allows you to download Burp Suite certificate and a large user-agent list for User-Agent Switcher. Making it one-click away to prepare your web-application testing browser.

# How does it differ from well-known projects, such as *OWASP Mantra* and *Hcon STF*? #
*OWASP Mantra* and *Hcon STF* are not regularly updated, and needs a lot of work in order to develop and maintain. Meanwhile, *Fsecurity* does not need a additional maintaining, although I would be maintaining it for any issues/bugs if needed. The used extensions are downloaded from Mozilla Addons Store with its latest version, to ensure the best testing experience for the penetration tester.

# Who can use *Fsecurity*? #
Web-Application Penetration Testers, Information Security Learners, and basically anyone interested in web-application security.
